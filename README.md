## **How It Works**
1. **Roblox Game** ðŸ¡† Sends a **POST request** when a player earns or loses honor.
2. **Server.js** ðŸ¡† Updates **Firebase** with the playerâ€™s **honor and time spent**.
3. **Rank Promotions** ðŸ¡† If the player meets the next rankâ€™s requirement, the **Roblox API updates their group rank**.
4. **Discord Bot** ðŸ¡† Fetches data from Firebase to allow users to check and modify honor.
5. **Honor Timer** ðŸ¡† Automatically adds **1 honor every 30 minutes** spent in-game.
